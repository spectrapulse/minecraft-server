itzg/minecraft-server with additions

## What has been added or changed about this image?
Not much. Currently only the webp libraries have been added to incorporate cwebp and dwebp into the image. This is useful when you happen to have dynmap installed and want dynmap to generate tiles in webp format.

An additional change made to this image is that the `EULA` environment variable is set to `TRUE` by default. There for if you want to make use of this image you automatically agree to Minecraft's EULA.
